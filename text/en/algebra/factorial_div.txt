\h1{ finding the degree of the divisor of factorial }
Given two numbers $n$ and $k$. You need to calculate the degree to which the divisor $k$ is the number $n!$, i.e. to find the $x$ such that $n!$ divisible by $k^x$.
\h2{ the Solution for the case of simple $k$ }
Consider first the case when $k$ is simple.
Let us write the expression for the factorial explicitly:
$$ n! = 1\ 2\ 3\ \ldots\ (n-1)\ n $$
Next, observe that for every $k^2$-th member of this series is divided into $k^2$, i.e., gives another 1 to the answer (given that $k$ in the first degree has already been posted before)
And so on, for every $k^i$-th term of the series gives 1 to the response, and the number of such members is $\lfloor n/k^i \rfloor$.
Thus, the answer is equal to the value:
$$ \frac{n}{k} \frac{n}{k^2} \ldots \frac{n}{k^i} \ldots $$
Implementation:
\code
int fact_pow (int n, int k) {
int res = 0
while (n) {
n /= k
res = n
}
return res
}
\endcode
\h2{ the Solution for the case of integral $k$ }
The same idea can apply directly here anymore.
But we can factor out $k$, solve the problem for each of its common divisor, and then choose the least of the answers.
