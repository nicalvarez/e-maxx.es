\h1{ balanced Ternary number system }
Ternary balanced radix - - is a non - standard positional numeral system. The base system is $3$, but it differs from the usual ternary system the fact that the figures are $-1, 0, 1$. Because you use $-1$ for a single digit is very uncomfortable, it usually takes some sort of special designation. Let's agree here to denote minus one letter $z$.
\h2{ Algorithm }
Learn how to translate the numbers in balanced ternary system.
To do this, we must first convert the number in the ternary system.
More gracefully above procedure can be described as follows. We take the number in the ternary number system, we add to it an infinite number of $\ldots 11111.11111 \ldots$, and then from each of the discharge of the subtract unit (without any breaks).
