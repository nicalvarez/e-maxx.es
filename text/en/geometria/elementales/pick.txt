\h1{ Theorem Peak. Finding the area of a lattice polygon }
A polygon without self-intersections is called a lattice if all its vertices are points with integer coordinates (Cartesian coordinate system).
\h2{ Theorem Peak }
\h3{ Formula }
Given a certain lattice polygon with a non-zero square.
Then just the ratio, called \bf{formula Maximum}:
$$ S = I \frac{B}{2} - 1. $$
In particular, if the known values of I and B for a given polygon, then its area can be computed in $O (1)$, not even knowing the coordinates of its vertices.
This ratio is opened and proved Austrian mathematician Georg Alexander Peak (Georg Alexander Pick) in 1899
\h3{ Proof }
The proof is done in several stages: from the simplest shapes to arbitrary polygons:
\ul{
\li Arbitrary nondegenerate rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. To prove the formula, we denote by $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. Then we find: $S = ab$, $I = (a-1)(b-1)$, $B = 2(a b)$. Direct substitution, we see that the formula of the Peak is correct.
\li an Arbitrary triangle. Note that any such triangle can be transformed into a rectangle sticking to the sides of right-angled triangles with legs parallel to the coordinate axes (you will need no more than 3 triangles). From here you can get the correct formula Maximum for any triangle.

\h2{ Generalization to higher dimensions }
Unfortunately, this is so simple and beautiful formula Peak poorly generalized to higher dimensions.
Demonstrated this Reeve (Reeve), suggesting that in 1957 to consider the tetrahedron (now called \bf{tetrahedron Riva}) with the following vertices:
$$ A = (0,0,0), $$
$$ B = (1,0,0), $$
$$ C = (0,1,0), $$
$$ D = (1,1,k), $$
