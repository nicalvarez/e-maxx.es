\h1{ finding the equation of the line segment }
Task --- according to the set coordinates of the end of the segment to construct the line passing through it.
We believe that the segment is non-degenerate, i.e. has a length greater than zero (otherwise, clear it passes through infinitely many different direct).
\h2{ two-Dimensional case }
Given a line segment $PQ$, i.e., the known coordinates of its ends $P_x$ and $P_y$, $Q_x$, $Q_y$.
$$ A x B y C = 0. $$
Note that the desired triples $(A,B,C)$ passing through a given segment, \bf{infinitely many}: you can multiply all three coefficients in an arbitrary nonzero number and get the same line. Therefore, our task is to find one of these triples.
It is easy to see (by substitution of these expressions and coordinates of points $P$ and $Q$ in the equation of a straight line) that fits the following set of factors:
$$ A = P_y - Q_y, $$
$$ B = Q_x - P_x, $$
$$ C = - A P_x - B P_y. $$
An important advantage of this method of building direct is that if the coordinates of the ends are integers, and the resulting coefficients will also be \bf{integer}. In some cases, it is possible to perform geometric operations, no recourse to real numbers.
\h3{ Veselinsky case }
When working with real numbers, you should always be aware of the errors.
The coefficients $A$ and $B$ we get the order of the source coordinates, the coefficient $C$ --- is the order of the square from them. This may already be sufficiently large numbers and, for example, if \algohref=lines_intersection{intersection} they will become even more, which can lead to large rounding errors already at the initial coordinates of order $10^3$.
$$ Z = \sqrt{ A^2 B^2 }, $$
and divide all three coefficients $A$, $B$, $C$ on it.
Thus, the order of the coefficients $A$ and $B$ will not depend on the order of the input coordinates, and the coefficient $C$ will be of the same order as the input coordinates. In practice, this leads to a significant improvement of the accuracy of calculations.
\h2{ three-Dimensional and multidimensional case }
Already in the three-dimensional case \bf{no simple equation} describing direct (it can be set as the intersection of two planes, i.e. a system of two equations, but this is an awkward way).
Therefore, three-dimensional and multidimensional cases, we must use \bf{a parametric way of direct job}, i.e., in the form of a point $p$ and a vector $v$:
$$ p v t, ~~~ t \in \cal{R}. $$
