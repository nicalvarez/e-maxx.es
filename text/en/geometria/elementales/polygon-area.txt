<h1>finding the area of a simple polygon</h1>
<p>given a simple polygon (i.e., without self-intersections, but not necessarily convex), specified by the coordinates of its vertices in order of traversal clockwise or counterclockwise. You want to find its area.</p>
<h2>Method 1</h2>
<formula>S = (X2 - X1) * (Y1-Y2) / 2</formula>
<p>Code:</p>
<code>double sq (const vector
{
double res = 0
for (unsigned i=0
{
point
p1 = i ? fig[i-1] : fig.back(),
p2 = fig[i]
res = (p1.x - p2.x) * (p1.y p2.y)
}
return fabs (res) / 2
}</code>
